                        Shahab and his daughter Yasmin are the current CEOs of Hyder Investments and YSH LLC. With Shahab finding his beginnings at a donut shop, he was no stranger to the food industry when he obtained his first McDonald's location. Yasmin, being surronded by all things McDonald's since here early days, took many different positions at the stores. Now, with years of experience, she has been an acting CEO since 2013.

He has worked for McDonald's for a good 26 year now, and has been with Hyder Investments and YSH LLC. for over 10 of those years. He's currently training a new set of Supervisors on what it takes to be successful in the industry. Hopefully they'll listen, because it seems he might know a thing or two with so many years under his belt!

As another member of the team who worked his way up, Ben knows just about everything there is to success in the stores!

As a Supervisor, Bryan will be closely monitoring a specific set of stores to ensure the dedication to customers that we expect is met. As a former member of McOpCo, we think Bryan is another key part of our team.

                        During our early 2018 acquistion of three new stores, we knew that more Supervisors would be needed. Looking in at our current set of staff, we saw Tyler as a great asset to our team that we felt would perform well in the Supervisor position. As he trains alongside Chris, Tyler is looking to carry the skills he learned from management at the stores to the corporate level. We think Tyler will do great as a Supervisor and we welcome him to the team!

                        Having a core set of staff to ensure our success outside of the stores is important. Linda is an integral part in making sure things go well both in and out of the stores. With a variety of tasks, some of the more important ones include entering new employees into our system and ensuring their information is done correctly.

                        Also known as, 'Mr.Fix it', Getu does much of his work in all of our stores. If there's anything wrong with one of the machines, whether it be the grills, the fryers, or perhaps the A/C, Getu works his magic to fix it quickly. As machines often malfunction, it's great to have Getu there to fix them in a timely manner. He's a big reason things run so smoothly!

                        As one of the members of our orientation team, Chris is responsible for welcoming our newest employees into our family of staff. Often, Chris will lead the presentations that teach our employees the secrets to doing well in the McDonald's environment. Chris is also responsible for maintaining our website, so he occasionally 'polishes' things up as needed!
